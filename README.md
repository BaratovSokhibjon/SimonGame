# Simon Game
This is a small game that is based on javascript and DOM manipulation. I created this game for the sake of practicing my skills.

## Usage
Go to: [https://baratovsokhibjon.github.io/SimonGame/](https://baratovsokhibjon.github.io/SimonGame/)

## Game:
- The game starts with a single tile getting clicked
- After clicking the correct tile the game shows you the next tile
- The proccess keeps repeating until payers lose track of the pattern
- Players should rememeber the paattern of the sequence in which the tiles are getting clicked
